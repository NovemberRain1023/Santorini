# Santorini

This is the game of Santorini. I built this game with front-end TypeScript, React and html. And back end with Java. 

I use npm to manage the package of TypeScript and Maven to manage the Java package.

In the front end side, execute the following commands in command line:
  npm run install
  npm run compile
  npm run start
Then the front-end is beginning.

In the back-end side, make sure Maven installed the whole packages.
The run the Main method in the App.java

Then we can play the game of Santorini!
